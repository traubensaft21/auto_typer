A simple Python script to tease your friends by spamming them with massages.
The script works by using the library pyauto and will repeatedly type the same text.
You can choose how often it repeats, as well what it will type.

The libraries you need to install for the script in order to work are in "auto_typer_install.txt" [In CMD type "pip install -r auto_typer_install.txt"].
